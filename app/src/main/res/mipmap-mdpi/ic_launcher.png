/**
 * <p>A {@code NamedDomainObjectCollection} represents a collection of domain objects that have an inherent, constant, name.</p>
 *
 * <p>Objects to be added to a named domain object collection must implement {@code equals()} in such a way that no two objects
 * with different names are considered equal. That is, all equality tests <strong>must</strong> consider the name as an
 * equality key. Behavior is undefined if two objects with different names are considered equal by their {@code equals()} implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>All implementations <strong>must</strong> guarantee that all elements in the collection are uniquely named. That is,
 * an attempt to add an object with a name equal to the name of any existing object in the collection will fail.
 * Implementations may choose to simply return false from {@code add(T)} or to throw an exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>Objects in the collection are accessible as read-only properties, using the name of the object
 * as the property name. For example (assuming the 'name' property provides the object name):</p>

 * books.add(new Book(name: "gradle", title: null))
